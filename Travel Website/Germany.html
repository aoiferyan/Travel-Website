                    <p style="margin-bottom:28px;">
                        From food to drink to the beautiful landscapes and architecture, Germany has a lot to offer the modern day travel addict.
                        I have visited here on many occasions and one of the things that always draws me back are the enchanting castles and
                        the quaint towns and villages that cannot be beat. The countryside in Germany is next to none and it is a great place to practice your German phrases.
                        I have always found Germany to be full of surprises and if you are up for a little road trip there is no place better to visit.
                        Car hire here is pretty straight forward and is probably the best way to travel but public transport is also very developed. So, whatever you
                        decide, i'm sure you will really enjoy your time in Germany.

                        I have visited many German cities in recent years and I find them to be very friendly and warm.
                        The people are friendly and there is a great melting pot of cultures. Cologne is a must visit with great pubs and bars and
                        the cathedral is a must see.
                        I recently visited frankfurt and this was an unexpected delight. It boasts a newly renovated old town that is very true to the previpous old town that was
                        there before the war. The city is a big business centre for Europe and has many skyrise buildings but you can still find old style German
                        building surviving in many parts. This can be seen in the main nightlife area where many pubs and clubs are inside old buildiings.
                        If you are planning a night on the town or some shopping on a Sunday think again, as many of the cities shops and bars close on a sunday.

                    <p>
                        This is one of my favourite things to do at Christmas time each year and nobody does is better than the Germans. Their Christmas
                        markets are next to none with plenty to do and see. There are plenty of stalls selling traditional Christmas drinks such as Mulled wine and
                        hot jagermeister. There are also plenty of stalls selling pretzels and bratwurst to keep your appetite as you stroll through the markets. You will
                        also find plenty of stalls selling handmade jewelry and handmade decorations so if it is gifts you are after there is plenty on offer.
                        I would recommend however, that you spend only two or threee days at the markets as you will not need that much time to see the whole
                        thing. This would be a great recommendation for a short city break.
