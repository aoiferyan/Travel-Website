                    <p>
                        In October 2018 we visited Montenegro. This is a small country in the Balkins
                        that has a lot to offer and is an up and coming tourist destination. This magnificent country boasts
                        beatiful coastline and mountains, along with mesmerising old towns including Kotor, Perast and Budva.
                        Kotor Bay is overlooked by a beautiful mountain that can be driven up via the serpentine road and this brings you through beautiful mounrtain villages
                        in the interior of the country. Food and drink prices are very reasonable with beer or wine as cheap as 3 euro and a main course
                        for 8 euro. The euro is the main currency and they drive on the right hand side of the road. I would highly recommend car hire
                        in this country firstly because public transport is not well developed and also because the scenery is so magnificent that you
                        may want to stop for some pictures. Kotor old town is a must see area and a trip up the old town walls should not be missed.

                    <p>
                        We visited Croatia in October 2018. This Country neighbours Montenegro and is another of the Balkin countries.
                        Dubrovnik became very popular through the filming of the popular TV show Game Of Thrones. The tourist scene here is very
                        strong with approximately 6 cruise ships docking here a day. Prices are a lot more expensive than other Balkin countries
                        so be prepared to pay extra for your oint or your nightly meal. A cable car to the top of the mountain is a must as the views are spectacular of Dubrovniks
                        Old Town. We didn't use car hire in Dubrovnik as the public transport system is quite developed but car hire is reasonable if it suits you.
